# Need to do
- SEC.gov provides various RSS feeds that would need to be scraped and filtered to be useful.
- otcmarkets - not sure yet
- scrape for other significant news that are not PR's, otcmarket, or SEC related, prioritize, archive, and send via email?
- create logging errors to be sent via email
- Need to decide between RSS feeds or JSON. Which provider of news will be the fastest and provide the most news, which format will it come in?
JSON or RSSS?
